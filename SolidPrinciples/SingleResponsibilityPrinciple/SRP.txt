What is:
- A class should have only one reason to change.
- A class should have only one responsibility.

Benefits:
- Less complexity, more readability —– one task in the class
- Reusability -- FileSaver
- Testability
- Coherence -- methods are more related/coherent
- Decoupling -- classes are less dependent on each other

Downsides:
- Might be difficult to organize so many classes
- Not clear what it means "single responsibility"

Keywords:
- Separating into classes/methods

Note: Refactoring2 seems to belong to OCP, but not SRP.
